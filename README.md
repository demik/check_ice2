# check_ice2

It is a Nagios plugin to check if a ICE or Shoucast stream status. It started as a fork of [pozar/check_ice](https://github.com/pozar/check_ice) by Tim Pozar but ended with a full rewrite. designed as a drop-in replacement for check_ice, with some additionnal features :

* IPv6 support
* ICY name checks

I plan to add more features in the future
